1. Covid will never be endemic. 2. Learning to live with it doesn't mean we leave at risk people behind 3. Address the air problem indoors 4.Vaccines alone don't work.

2022-06-08 23:59:36+00:00,@middlingobiwan I used to believe that as well. I spent my entire adult life vaccinating people. I wouldn't give my dog the covid vaccine. It should have been recalled after a few deaths. It would have been off the market if we were living during a normal time.
2022-06-08 23:59:34+00:00,"But how would pregnant people access this? ü§î

Pregnant people can receive a DTAP vaccine during every pregnancy, at the preferred interval based on fetus age, regardless of their last date of vaccine.
When will we allow pregnant women to make this choice with the covid vaccine? https://t.co/Pap952BbqQ"

2022-06-08 23:58:57+00:00,@NSFWPoliticsNow @noovohreesh @blackbear93 @StrikeDebt @bergeronprocess COVID still here right? What about the testing they stopped doing? What about the vaccine not being free anymore? What about everything that isn't just UE? Also UE being under 4% means nothing when people need 2-3 jobs and still aren't making it. And UE measures are shit anyway.

2022-06-08 23:58:47+00:00,@sir19631 @SimonJamesOShea @AnnieIrish68 @BluewoodHomes The vaccines? Yes they most certainly can be and they are shown to only have a 1% efficacy rate after several weeks. Not worth the risk. You're better off getting a mild case of Covid and getting over it to have 10% more immunity
2022-06-08 23:58:43+00:00,"Another interesting slide, this one from @VoiceOfFranky, a poll: if they believe Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. Responses depended on how many Covid vaccines the respondents have received.

- 88% of those with 3 vaccines say yes.
- 32% of vaccines refusers say yes. https://t.co/74Y77eKoIV"

You are not anti vaccine, &amp; you were simply pointing out that the risk of long COVID is not eliminated by vaccination, it is only reduced
